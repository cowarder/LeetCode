description:
Given a binary array, find the maximum number of consecutive 1s in this array.

Example 1:
Input: [1,1,0,1,1,1]
Output: 3
Explanation: The first two digits or the last three digits are consecutive 1s.
    The maximum number of consecutive 1s is 3.



class Solution {
public:
    int findMaxConsecutiveOnes(vector<int>& nums) {
	int maxLength = 0;
	int i = 0;
	while (i != nums.size()) {
		if (nums[i] == 1) {
			int j = 0;
			while (nums[i + j] == 1) {
				j++;
			}
			if (j > maxLength)
				maxLength = j;
		}
		i++;
	}
	return maxLength;
